# git builtin facilities #
## subtree merge strategy ##
   * setup involves a number of different commands/options: annoying
   * cloning a repo with subtrees requires re-registration of remote branches
   * no opting out of registered dependencies--one nicety of submodules
   * praised for 'less, long-term administrative burden': given the simplicity the end result, i can believe it.
   * compatible with all versions of git (submodules were introduced in 1.5.3)
   * not well-advertised... why didn't i know about this feature before?
