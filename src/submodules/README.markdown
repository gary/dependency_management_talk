# Git Submodule Example Application #
## Getting Started ##
   * `rake gems:install`
   * `cd ../../`
   * git submodule init
   * git submodule update
   * cd -
   * run migrations, etc.

## Gotchas ##
All submodule operations must be performed from the repository's root.
Normally this would be a non-issue, but since I chose to include all
example projects in this presentation's repository, you will be
inconvenienced.
